# Portfolio Investments
Final project for UGBA 147 - Advanced Business Analytics
Objective is to build a predictive model to recommend a portfolio of 12 companies that maximizes 12-month return of $1,000,000 overall
I used three different models and picked the best one: stacking ensemble method using three support-vector machines and naive bayes, neural network, and boosting ensemble method using support-vector machines. Overall, the boosing method had a 92% accuracy tested on a five-fold cross validation.
